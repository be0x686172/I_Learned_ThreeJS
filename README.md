## 💡 What I learned

The hardest part of a coding project isn't coding, but implementing its architecture. You need to create scalable, maintainable, and easily debuggable code that's understandable to others, and where each class must be independent.

## 🚀 Features

- Move forward, backward, left, and right (ZASD)
- Shoot (Left Click)
